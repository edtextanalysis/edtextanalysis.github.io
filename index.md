# About Edinburgh Text Analysis Research Group

The Edinburgh Text Analysis Research Group (EdTA) provides postgraduate students and academics with a platform to discuss projects, issues and ideas related to Computational Text Analysis (also referred to as Automated Content Analysis, Quantitative Content Analysis, Text as Data, Text Mining, and so on).

The Edinburgh Text Analysis Research Group organises monthly seminar and workshop over the course of the year to discuss ideas about the use of Computational Text Analysis with a particular focus of social sciences and humanities researches. Workshops are aimed at Social Sciences and Humanities researchers who have had no formal training in Computer Science but are interested in exploring a range of different methods related to Computational Text Analysis (broadly construed), these include: sentiment analysis, topic modelling, clustering, wordscores, wordfish, ensemble classification, ngram networks and others. Individuals from all backgrounds and levels are welcomed to attend.
